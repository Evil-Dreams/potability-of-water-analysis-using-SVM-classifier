# Water Potability Analysis using SVM Classifier

This project analyzes water quality data and predicts whether water is safe for drinking using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model.

The dataset includes multiple physicochemical parameters such as pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity. Missing values are handled during preprocessing to ensure reliable model performance.

After data cleaning and feature selection, an SVM classifier is trained to classify water samples as potable or non-potable. Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics.

Python and Jupyter Notebook are used along with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

This project is useful for understanding water quality assessment, environmental data analysis, and applying machine learning models in real-world health and safety scenarios.
